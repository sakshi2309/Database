# Voter Registration System: Database
Design Specification- We have created a transactional application to access the database through a web page wherein an admin can look up details of a selected voter, delete and update information, while a new user can register and an existing user can update his relevant information.
Use Cases-
To the Voter Database system designed we have selected three specific use cases having different functionalities. As soon as the web page is displayed the User is prompted for three options i) admin ii) User iii) New User
i)	Admin -  In this use case as we go through the website and If the user is admin the webpage will be displayed to enter the credentials (i.e. username, password) and if the given credentials are correct the admin will be prompted to new page where he will be allowed to update the information about users. Admin can also log out
ii)	Users -  In this use case if the user has been prompted to the users webpage he would be asked his voter registration number and his first name. On entering the right credentials, he would be allowed to update his existing information.
iii)	New Users -  When prompted for this use case the new user will be allowed to enter all his personal details and a voter registration number is assigned which is auto increment in nature.
